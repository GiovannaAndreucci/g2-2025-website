<p class="mt-3"><strong>The structure of the work is organised around key thematic areas:</strong></p>

<p>
The project framework is designed to offer an <strong>interdisciplinary approach</strong>, combining technical methodologies such as <strong>data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence</strong> with broader considerations. The content is structured to alternate between <strong>theoretical guidance</strong> and <strong>practical exploration</strong>, encouraging users to apply concepts through hands-on development of a data-driven application or story.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the development, you will engage with <strong>real-world datasets</strong>, explore <strong>data-driven narratives</strong>, and reflect on the <strong>ethical and social implications</strong> of your choices. The structure is designed to be modular, allowing flexibility while maintaining a coherent narrative flow.
